# Potential configuration heirarchy
#

#
# A "source" is a source for a number of packages. We'll initially start supporting one 
# type: apt.sources

apt.sources:
 #
 # A "distribution" (such as "Debian" or "NeuroDebian") is a collection of sources already
 # known to ReproNim with built-in logic to pull dated snapshots of packages.
 #
 - name: NeuroDebian-1
   distribution: NeuroDebian
   type: deb
   suite: xenial
   architecture: amd64
   component: main
 #
 # If repronim isn't familiar with the source's distribution, just record the 
 # sources.list information
 #
 - name: us.archive.ubuntu.com-1
   uri: http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
   type: deb
   suite: xenial
   architecture: amd64
   component: main

#
# Once we have sources, we can then state where packages come from. I
# was interested in trying to list multiple sources for a single
# package, but this gets complex: a package in Debian may be split
# across multiple packages in RHEL or CentOS. Maybe we should have
# multiple package lists depending upon architecture?
#

apt.packages:
 #
 # For apt, we need to use "dpkg -s" to get installed information
 # We use "apt-cache show" to get the MD5sum (if available)
 # "apt-cache showpkg" to get repository information for installed package
 # We can use the date of /var/lib/dpkg/info/PACKAGE.list to get the install date:
 #  "stat -c %y /var/lib/dpkg/info/fslview.list"
 #
 # From "(/var/lib/apt/lists/neuro.debian.net_debian_dists_xenial_main_binary-amd64_Packages)"
 # we'd have to glean the right source
 # 
 # For "xterm" I have a version (297-1ubuntu1) that is older than the current one
 # (322-1ubuntu1). For this reason we can't get the MD5sum or the size from "apt-cache show".
 # And we have to guess the distribution using the information from the newest version
 # using "apt-cache showpkg"
 #
 - name: xterm
   source: us.archive.ubuntu.com-1
   version: 297-1ubuntu1
   date: 2016-09-10 09:37:49.627803689 -0400

 # 
 # For "fslview" we do have the latest version, so I gcan get the filename, size, and
 # hash information.
